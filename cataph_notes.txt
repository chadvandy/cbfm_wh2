AK_repanse_tech

=== Wrong effects in Repanse's techs tech_dlc14_brt_righteous_strength and tech_dlc14_brt_prayer_of_fortitude now affect bretonnian characters, previously too tall. (Including Mixu's)

(tech to effect)
added bretonnian characters to the dwf_characters set so that we don't have to do ugly stuff to visible effects. No foreseeable side effects except on very specific mods that move those subtypes around. Includes Mixu's LLs since we're at it.



AK_morathi_agents_upk

=== Adds Master to Morathi's upkeep reduction list.

self explanatory. Should be removed asap to avoid double tapping. 



AK_dwf_char_tech

=== Adds missing DLC characters to the list for some dwarf hero/lord buffs.

ditto.


emp_archer fixes

===  Fixes a double bug with wrong and missing textures on Empire Archers.


Restores missing textures (archer body diffuse and mask) so that base Emp Archers use their own stuff instead of borrowing from Deathjacks. Edits the Emp Archers unused body materials to use these textures. Edits the Emp Archer vmd to use wsmodels.



AK_durkits

=== fixes wrong unit caste for ROR Squig Hoppers.

melee infantry to melee cavalry.
