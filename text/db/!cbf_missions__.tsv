missions_localised_description_wh2_main_great_vortex_lzd_mazdamundi_cobra_mace_of_mazdamundi_stage_3_mpc	The coming of the Twin-Tailed Comet has destabilised the Great Vortex, and Chaos rises. Lord Mazdamundi, greatest of Mage-Priests, senses this is a portent for something far worse – that the Great Plan is failing. The certain cause is the vile proliferation of warmbloods within his realm. There must come a purge! \\n\\n Yet in this he is thwarted, for since his awakening he is without his fabled Cobra Mace. The semi-sentient weapon of legend was long ago left to regain its fading power from the sacred rocks of the Isle of the Crimson Skull. For the purge to proceed, it must be reclaimed forthwith. \\n\\n Yet darker news awaits. Accursed Skaven swarm across the hallowed isle, covetous of its sorcerous stones. This outrage must be repaid – and only absolute extinction will suffice.	true

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_gorrok_the_shield_of_aeons_stage_2_other	Gor-Rok's scouts spot several sizeable armies of both the irrepressible Undead and those insidious rat-vermin heading directly for Itza! Such a calamity cannot be allowed to befall the Lustria's First City, but it's unlikely that the Great White Lizard's forces will be able to hold both fell hosts back alone. A different, more lateral approach is therefore the order of the day. As such, Gor-Rok must invoke the Rite of Awakening, so that our forces are - with the sacred blessings of the venerated Old Ones - as prepared for the struggle ahead as they possibly can be.	true
