AK_repanse_tech

(tech to effect)
added bretonnian characters to the dwf_characters set so that we don't have to do ugly stuff to visible effects. No foreseeable side effects except on very specific mods that move those subtypes around. Includes Mixu's LLs since we're at it.



AK_morathi_agents_upk

=== Adds Master to Morathi's upkeep reduction list.

self explanatory. Should be removed asap to avoid double tapping.
